# Turns

* During turns, place hand on back of follower to have more connection
* Turns happen at a different point in the bar compared to Salsa; follower usually needs to do one step before entering the turn

# Leading 
* Offer hand to follower for the next element at the latest on the second tschick
* Leading on hand vs. wrist makes no difference
* Other points of contact for leading: arms, elbows, shoulders, point behind the neck
* Horinzontal leading: "the normal way"
* Vertical leading: Turning chicken
* Turns with head movement: vertical and horizontal combined

# Interrupting an element
* after before 1 or after 3
* Follower has the three steps for themselves

# Giving Room for Styling for Followers
* From lateral while the leader is standing still (follower can do styling in front of leader, kinda like in Salsa)
* Do a soltinho, then let follower go; turn to your hearts contempt; seek visual connection between turns

# Body Wave
* Free hand is showing thw angle 
* Always do a full wave that leads back to the neutral position
* 

# Launch
* Upper body straight
* Hand in right height for the next element
